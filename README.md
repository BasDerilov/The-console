# The-console

The console is just a little exercise which I maybe spent too much time on.

## Dependencies

The only thing you need installed to run the app is NodeJS and git.

### How to run

Getting the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/BasDerilov/The-console.git && cd The-console`

Switching to the slots game branch:

`git checkout slots`

To install all dependencies:

`npm install`

Running the dev environment:

`npm run dev`

Building for production (hypothetically)

`npm run build`

The compiled static files should appear in the dist folder if parcel is configured correctly (by default)
