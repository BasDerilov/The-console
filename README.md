# The-console

The console is just a little exercise which I maybe spent too much time on.

## Dependencies

The only thing you need installed to run the app is NodeJS and git.

### How to run 

Getting the repo:

 `git clone https://github.com/BasDerilov/The-console.git && cd The-console`

To install all dependancies:

 `npm ci`

Running the dev environment:

 `npm run dev`

Building for production (hypothetically)

 `npm run build`

The compiled static files should appear in the dist folder if parcel is configured correctly (by default)
